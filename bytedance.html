									I spent the summer of 2021 at <a=href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance">ByteDance</a>. <br/>
									This internship drastically improved my <b>data analysis and digital marketing</b> skills,
as I got the chance to experience <b>sales support, business development and E-Commerce campaign branding</b>.<br/>
I spent my summer at ZERO Education Department, a division of ByteDance, where I ran live-streaming sales operations
for an innovative educational hardware product on different platforms such as TikTok and Tmall, etc.<br/>

This internship is a memory that sticks with me, not only because it is the milestone that I finally took the first step I dreamed of:
<b>have my internship at a technology company</b>, but also, I had the privilege of being involved in a newly established business/department.<br/>
I was involved in many new and exciting projects such as business workflow planning, recruitment
(we only had three people at first and ten people when I left), market exploration and many other that I can only experience as a "First Generation Intern".<br/>
The environment was <b>ambiguous, fast-paced, and fast-growing</b>, and it just felt like working for a start-up company.<br/>
