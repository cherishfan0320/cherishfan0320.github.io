									<b>Hello!</b><br/>
									I'm glad you are here, after all, it means you are interested in me!<br/>
I'm from China, as I was born in a City called Wuhan(a LOT of GREAT FOOD over there).
And I came to Canada alone when I was fifteen years old,
so I spent a lot of time with myself reading, watching movies and drawing.<br/>
(yes, I only started programming when I entered University)<br/>
									<br/>
									Of course, in case you're interested, I'm an 🥑 🥑 🥑 <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality">INFJ</a> 🥑 🥑 🥑.<br/>
									<br/>
									Although I am a cs student, I have an immense passion for literature. Especially British medieval classics, as well as 80's science fiction.<br/>
									🙌🏼 Here are some of my personal favourites.</p>

I have had a natural affinity for space operas and futuristic fantasies, since I have always found myself a lot courage and inspiration from stories and characters.
And I think science fiction and sci-fi movies are the last bastion of modern philosophy.
When I go along with the adventures stories, the volyage into a strange universe,
it always gives me nostalgia and a kind of reflection on life and something much greater than us.<br/>

These reflections make me sometimes get lost in my thoughts from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
									<p>Besides, I am also into Journaling, Camping, Violin and Gaming. I studied violin when I was 4, and this is now an unseparated part of my life. Even though I found other passions through my experience, violin would always be something that stuck deep inside me.</p>

									<p>Besides all those interests, I've always tried to separate my hobby from my work, but I've gradually found a balance; combining my interests in painting, philosophical thought,
										and literature with technology, design, and marketing has often produced an unexpected effect.<br/>

										Well... Let's have my favourite quote from Star Trek as the ending of this page:</p>

<pre><code><font size="+0.5">Space: the final frontier.<span class="image right" style="width:180px";><img src="images/stmeme.jpg" alt="" /></span>

	These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
	Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds.
	To seek out new life and new civilizations.

	<b>💫💫💫To boldly go where no man has gone before!💫💫💫</b>
