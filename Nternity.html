As the history of humanity is speeding into the cyberpunk era, the government is secretly researching a program called "Time Machine".<br/>
The story will divide into two lines, one for the timeline's future, a replica called Eta is the primary test subject of time travel, and her creator, Dr Hos, seems to have some ulterior motives.<br/>
In the Victorian era(the second line), in a steampunk worldview, a mechanic named Orville finds a mysterious girl "falling from the sky" in his attic...</blockquote></p>

									This is a story that I was thinking about it when I was 15. It changed a lot through years passed, and it seems the story cannot ever be ssttled.<br/>
							The only thing remains, is that I am continuous working on it...<br/>
						I was able to get touched with Unity on my second year Game Design course, and I mostly did the design and logistics works.
						Below are some of the game screenshot we made in 2019.(It is a detective game)</p>

									Consistently working on a project is challenging, especially despised when your life is busy.<br/>
So I set myself a goal at the end of 2020 to make a demo of the first chapter of this game, which,
despite its roughness, was backed by barely more than 7 hours of sleep a day in December.
It was exhausting but also exhilarating.
I used Unity and Fungus as my game engine, but at the same time I am considerng RPG maker and Renpy...<br/>
Here are some of my character designs and some of the game item designs.<br/></p>

<br/><p>I also did some pixel-art design, because for a while I've been trying out RPG Maker (because I really like the undertale style).<br/></p>
